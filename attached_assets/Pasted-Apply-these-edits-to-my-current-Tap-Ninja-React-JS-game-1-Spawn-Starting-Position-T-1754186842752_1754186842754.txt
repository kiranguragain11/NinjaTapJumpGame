Apply these edits to my current Tap Ninja React JS game:

1. **Spawn & Starting Position**
   - The ninja must always start standing on top of the first platform.
   - The spawn point should be fixed near the left side of that first platform.
   - Remove any random or mid-air spawning — start position must be consistent.

2. **Start Screen**
   - On page load, display a centered **start screen**:
     - Large title: "kiranGuragain Game"
     - Small description below: "An anime-style rooftop ninja runner."
     - Big "Start Game" button centered.
   - When "Start Game" is clicked:
     - Transition to the game window (canvas).
     - Do NOT show the start button again after entering the game.

3. **Tap-to-Start Inside Game Window**
   - Inside the game window (before movement begins), show faded small text at the bottom center: "Tap to start".
   - First tap/click should:
     - Trigger the ninja's first jump toward the next platform.
     - Start the game movement loop.

4. **Game Speed**
   - Background and platforms must move at the **same speed** (remove fast parallax effect).
   - Initial speed should be slow for easy starting.
   - **Increase speed** slightly every time the player successfully jumps to the next rooftop.
   - Keep smooth acceleration so the game feels natural.

5. **Score System**
   - +1 point for each successful jump to another platform.
   - +5 points for each coin/gem collected.
   - Remove any time-based scoring.
   - Display the score in the top-left corner using a stylish English font such as:
     - `"Orbitron"` or `"Press Start 2P"` from Google Fonts.
   - Make the score text clean and readable.

6. **Platforms**
   - Generate rooftops endlessly with random gap widths.
   - The ninja should run automatically after the first tap.
   - Jump physics must allow the player to naturally land on the next platform if timed correctly.

7. **Ninja Sprite**
   - Replace placeholder box with an actual ninja sprite from Kenney.nl or similar.
   - Animate running when on a platform.
   - Use a jump frame/animation when in the air.

8. **Coins / Gems**
   - Spawn coins or gems on some rooftops.
   - Collecting them should instantly add to the score.
   - Use free sprites from Kenney.nl or OpenGameArt.org.

9. **Background**
   - Use an anime-style Japanese city skyline or rooftop background that scrolls with the same speed as platforms.
   - Keep it visually appealing but not distracting.
   - No Japanese text anywhere — English only.

10. **Game Over**
    - If the ninja falls off a platform, end the game immediately.
    - Display "Game Over" in large bold letters.
    - Below it, show "Click to Restart".
    - Restart should return the player to the start screen with the "Start Game" button.

11. **Visual Appeal**
    - Add soft drop shadows to text.
    - Use smooth animations for UI transitions.
    - Make sure ninja sprite, coins, and rooftops have vibrant colors.
    - Keep gameplay smooth at 60 FPS.
