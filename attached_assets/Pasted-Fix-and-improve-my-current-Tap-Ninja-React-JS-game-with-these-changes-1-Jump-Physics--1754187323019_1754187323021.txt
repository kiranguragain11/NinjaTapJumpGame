Fix and improve my current Tap Ninja React JS game with these changes:

1. **Jump Physics**
   - Make the jump arc **fast and snappy**:
     - Increase initial jump velocity.
     - Increase gravity so the ninja comes down faster.
     - No slow floaty jumps — jumps should be quick like in platformer games.
   - Ninja should be able to double jump with a second quick tap in the air.

2. **Platform Speed & Difficulty**
   - Platforms should scroll toward the left **faster**.
   - Start at a decent running speed — not painfully slow.
   - Increase platform scroll speed slightly every time the player lands on a new rooftop.
   - Keep the gameplay smooth at **60 FPS** using `requestAnimationFrame`.

3. **Coins**
   - Spawn coins above some rooftops.
   - Collecting a coin adds **+5 points**.
   - Coins should animate slightly (spin or bounce) to be noticeable.
   - Use a free coin sprite from Kenney.nl or OpenGameArt.org.

4. **Background & Buildings**
   - Add a **layer of buildings** under the rooftops so the city looks full.
   - Background should scroll at the **same pace as platforms** (no weird parallax speed mismatch).
   - Remove the empty gap under rooftops — it looks unrealistic.

5. **Score System**
   - +1 point for each successful jump to another platform.
   - +5 for each coin collected.
   - Display score at the top-left using `"Orbitron"` or `"Press Start 2P"` font from Google Fonts.
   - Make score text larger and always visible.

6. **Start Game Glitch**
   - Fix the bug where clicking "Start Game" doesn’t immediately start the game.
   - First click should:
     - Hide the start screen instantly.
     - Load the game window.
     - Show a **"Tap to Start"** faded message.
     - First tap after that should start movement immediately — no multiple clicks needed.

7. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Game canvas should resize automatically to fit mobile screens.
   - Touch events should work the same as clicks.
   - UI elements (score, start button, messages) should be scaled for mobile readability.

8. **Ninja Sprite**
   - Keep using a proper ninja sprite (Kenney.nl or similar).
   - Animate running when on ground.
   - Show a jump frame when in air.
   - The ninja must always face forward — no flipping backwards.

9. **Game Flow**
   - Always start with the ninja standing on a platform.
   - After "Start Game" → show game canvas → first tap starts the run.
   - No extra start button inside the game window.
   - If game over → show "Game Over" and "Click to Restart" → return to start screen.

10. **Visual Polish**
    - Add smooth transitions for UI elements.
    - Use soft shadows for text and UI to make them stand out.
    - Keep bright, saturated colors for the ninja, coins, and rooftops so they pop.
